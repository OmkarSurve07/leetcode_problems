## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my solutions to competitive programming problems from LeetCode and HackerRank. The goal is to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented Python solutions that use object-oriented programming principles.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── LeetCode
│   ├── problem1_solution.py
│   ├── problem2_solution.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each solution file contains:
- Problem description (as comments)
- Solution class with methods
- Example usage

## How to Use

To use or test any solution in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode_problems.git
   cd leetcode_problems
   ```

1. Navigate to the desired platform directory (LeetCode or HackerRank) and open the problem solution file you are interested in.

2. Run the solution file directly to see the output. For example:
   ```sh
   python LeetCode/problem1_solution.py
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that is not yet in the repository or an improvement to an existing solution, feel free to open a pull request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Open a pull request

```
Feel free to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the `git clone` command. This `README.md` file provides a structured and comprehensive guide for your repository, making it easy for others to navigate, use, and contribute to your solutions.
